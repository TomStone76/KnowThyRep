# KnowThyRep

This is a collaborative project involving HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and API implementation. It is a voter education tool that facilitates the process of learning about U.S. Senators and U.S. Representatives - and makes the process more enjoyable. A user can search for an elected official and get important data about them, along with relevant YouTube videos.
